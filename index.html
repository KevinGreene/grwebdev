    We are a group of web developers in the Grand Rapids, MI area. We discuss all parts of developing for the web, from HTML, CSS, and Javascript to design, user experience, usability, accessibility, and tools.

Whether you write code, write content, design, or manage, when you work on the web there is a lot of common ground. Join us to learn from each other about best web practices, cross-browser compatibility, Javascript frameworks, style hacks, HTML5, and other web-related topics.

You should also join our discussion mailing list or you will miss out on all of the topical discussions. http://groups.google.com/group/grwebdev

Thanks for checking out the Grand Rapids Web Development group!
